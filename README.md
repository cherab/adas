adas
====

Atomic data package based on the ADAS subscriber package installed at many fusion facilities. You need an ADAS subscription to use this package.

Set the ADAS environment variables before using this package by running `source /home/adas/setup/adas_setup.ksh` if your Unix shell is sh, bash or ksh,
or `source /home/adas/setup/adas_setup.csh` if your Unix shell is tcsh.

Please see the main CHERAB [documentation](https://cherab.github.io/documentation/index.html)
for guidance on using the code.
